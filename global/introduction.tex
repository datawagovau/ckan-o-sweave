This report template extends the beautifully designed
\href{http://www.latextemplates.com/template/the-legrand-orange-book}{Legrand Orange Book}
\LaTeX\ template with \href{https://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/}{Sweave},
which marries up executable R code with \LaTeX\ markup.

It was originally developed by Florian Mayer at the Western Australian Department
of Parks and Wildlife for a multi-author, data-driven, internal reporting task,
and has since been refactored into this open source template.
